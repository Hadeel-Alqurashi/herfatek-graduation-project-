ABSTRACT:
Now there are many applications and websites for teaching handicrafts, but some of them are limited to courses only and some are on one craft, and they are also available in English only.

The application "ِحرفتك "brings together craftsmen of various types of handicrafts in one platform to make it easier for learners to find courses and workshops suitable for them, and also displays sites for providing handicrafts supplies because of the difficulty of finding them easily.
